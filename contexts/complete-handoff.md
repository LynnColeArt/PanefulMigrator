# Migration Utility Development Status and Context

## About Paneful
Paneful is an art generation toolkit that:
- Takes a single image and slices it into a grid
- Can process these slices through Stable Diffusion for variations
- Reassembles the pieces in various ways (exact, random, multi-scale)
- Supports layering text and effects
- Generates different types of controlnet maps
- Creates surreal/impossible collages from the original image

Current codebase handles:
- Image slicing and reassembly
- Grid management
- Effect application
- Text overlay
- Controlnet map generation

## Why Migration is Needed
The current Paneful codebase has grown organically and needs restructuring:
- Code is scattered across top-level functions directory
- Strategy and factory patterns need proper implementation
- Resources (models, dictionaries, fonts) need organization
- Configuration is partially hardcoded
- Current structure makes maintenance difficult

## Migration Utility Purpose
Building a tool to:
1. Analyze current project structure
2. Plan and execute reorganization following best practices
3. Implement proper separation of concerns:
   - Core functionality
   - Transform operations
   - Resource management
   - User interfaces
4. Preserve git history while reorganizing
5. Validate the new structure meets design requirements

## Current Structure
Migration utility development is in progress. Basic directory structure has been created and verified using directory_mapper.py:

```
├── main.py
├── core/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── display.py
│   └── scanner.py
├── planner/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── mapper.py
└── resources/
    ├── directory_structure.yaml
    └── migration_mapping.yaml
```

## Current State
- setup.py has been run and created basic directory structure
- migration_utility.py was created in error and should be removed
- main.py will be our primary program file
- Directory structure is clean and ready for component implementation

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Implement core/scanner.py first:
   - Project scanning functionality
   - File classification
   - Content analysis
   - Size tracking

2. Then core/display.py:
   - Menu system
   - Content display
   - User interaction
   - Progress feedback

3. Finally planner/mapper.py:
   - Migration planning
   - Path resolution
   - Validation rules

## Implementation Context
- Working within paneful2/migration_utility/
- Goal is to reorganize paneful project structure
- Need to keep code modular and maintainable
- Using YAML for configuration
- Following Python best practices

## Design Decisions Made
1. Separating concerns into core/ and planner/
2. Using resources/ for configuration files
3. Scanner as foundation for other components
4. Main program as coordinator

## Important Notes
- Code from previous plans exists but needs to be implemented piece by piece
- Need to implement one component at a time, testing as we go
- Keep focus on maintainability and clear documentation
- Project is following standard directory structure patterns

## Design Goals
- Make Paneful more maintainable
- Properly implement design patterns
- Separate concerns clearly
- Move configuration to proper config files
- Create clear resource management
- Make future development easier

## Technical Requirements
- Must handle various file types (Python, config, resources)
- Must preserve git history during migration
- Must validate new structure meets requirements
- Must handle large files (models) appropriately
- Must provide clear feedback during migration process
- Must allow for rollback if issues occur

## Development Approach
- Building components incrementally
- Testing each component thoroughly
- Keeping code modular and maintainable
- Following Python best practices
- Maintaining clear documentation
- Using type hints and proper error handling
- Implementing logging throughout
